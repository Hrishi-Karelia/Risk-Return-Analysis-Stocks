Risk and Return Analysis of Selected Indian Stocks using Modern Portfolio Theory (Python)

Project Overview

This project analyzes the risk-return characteristics of selected Indian large-cap stocks using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The objective is to evaluate individual stock performance, measure risk, apply CAPM, and construct an optimal portfolio using portfolio optimization techniques.

The analysis demonstrates practical implementation of financial theory using Python for real-world stock data.

Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

To calculate annual returns of selected stocks

To measure volatility (total risk)

To compute Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted performance

To calculate Beta (systematic risk)

To apply CAPM and estimate expected returns

To construct the Efficient Frontier

To identify the Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio

Stocks Analyzed

Reliance Industries

TCS

HDFC Bank

Infosys

ICICI Bank

These large-cap stocks were selected from different sectors to observe diversification benefits.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

yFinance

Methodology
1. Data Collection

Historical stock price data was fetched using the yFinance library.

Reason: Adjusted closing prices are required to calculate accurate daily returns including dividends and splits.

2. Calculation of Daily Returns

Daily returns were computed using percentage change of adjusted closing prices.

Reason: Returns are more meaningful than raw prices when comparing stock performance.

3. Annual Return Calculation

Annual return was calculated by multiplying average daily return by 252 (average trading days in a year).

Reason: Annualizing returns allows standardized comparison across stocks.

4. Volatility Calculation

Annual volatility was calculated as:

Standard Deviation of Daily Returns × √252

Reason: Volatility represents total risk and price fluctuations of the stock.

5. Risk vs Return Analysis

A scatter plot was created to compare annual returns and annual volatility of each stock.

Reason: This helps visualize the relationship between risk and return.

6. Sharpe Ratio

Sharpe Ratio was calculated using:

(Portfolio Return − Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility

Reason: It measures risk-adjusted return. Higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better performance per unit of risk.

7. Portfolio Simulation and Efficient Frontier

Thousands of random portfolios were generated by assigning random weights to stocks.

For each portfolio:

Expected return was calculated

Volatility was calculated

Sharpe Ratio was computed

The Efficient Frontier was plotted.

Reason: The Efficient Frontier identifies optimal portfolios that offer maximum return for a given level of risk.

8. Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

The portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio was identified.


Reason: This portfolio provides the best risk-adjusted performance.

9. Beta Calculation

Beta was calculated relative to the market index.

Reason: Beta measures systematic risk and sensitivity to market movements.

10. CAPM Analysis

CAPM formula used:

Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × (Market Return − Risk-Free Rate)

Actual returns were compared with CAPM expected returns.

Reason: To determine whether stocks are overperforming or underperforming relative to market expectations.

Portfolio Optimization

Diversification

Results and Insights

Higher return stocks generally exhibited higher volatility.

Diversification reduced overall portfolio risk.

The Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio provided the best risk-adjusted performance.

Some stocks outperformed their CAPM expected return.

Portfolio optimization significantly improved return per unit of risk.![Uploading 810f3383-1091-4651-9425-721aa61a8d15.png…]()


Conclusion

This project successfully applies Modern Portfolio Theory to analyze and optimize a portfolio of Indian large-cap stocks.

The analysis confirms that:

Risk and return are positively related.

Diversification reduces unsystematic risk.

Portfolio optimization improves risk-adjusted performance.

CAPM provides a useful benchmark for expected returns.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in financial analysis, portfolio optimization, risk management, and data analysis using Python.
