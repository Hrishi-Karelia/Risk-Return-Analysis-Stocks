# Risk-Return-Analysis-Stocks

**Risk and Return Analysis of Selected Indian Stocks using Modern Portfolio Theory (Python)**

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the risk-return characteristics of selected Indian large-cap stocks using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The objective is to evaluate individual stock performance, measure risk, apply CAPM, and construct an optimal portfolio using portfolio optimization techniques.

The analysis demonstrates practical implementation of financial theory using Python for real-world stock data.

---

## Objectives

- Calculate annual returns of selected stocks
- Measure volatility (total risk)
- Compute Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted performance
- Calculate Beta (systematic risk)
- Apply CAPM and estimate expected returns
- Construct the Efficient Frontier
- Identify the Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio

## Stocks Analyzed

| Stock | Sector |
|---|---|
| Reliance Industries | Energy / Conglomerate |
| TCS | Information Technology |
| HDFC Bank | Banking & Finance |
| Infosys | Information Technology |
| ICICI Bank | Banking & Finance |

These large-cap stocks were selected from different sectors to observe diversification benefits.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
Historical stock price data was fetched using the `yFinance` library. Adjusted closing prices are used to calculate accurate daily returns, accounting for dividends and splits.

### 2. Daily Returns
Daily returns were computed using the percentage change of adjusted closing prices. Returns are more meaningful than raw prices when comparing stock performance across assets.

### 3. Annual Return Calculation
Annual return was calculated by multiplying the average daily return by **252** (average trading days in a year), enabling standardized comparison across stocks.

### 4. Volatility Calculation
Annual volatility was calculated as:

```
Annual Volatility = Standard Deviation of Daily Returns × √252
```

Volatility represents total risk and price fluctuations of the stock.

### 5. Risk vs. Return Analysis
A scatter plot was created to compare annual returns and annual volatility of each stock, visualizing the relationship between risk and reward.

### 6. Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe Ratio was calculated as:

```
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return − Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility
```

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better performance per unit of risk taken.

### 7. Portfolio Simulation & Efficient Frontier
Thousands of random portfolios were generated by assigning random weights to stocks. For each portfolio, the expected return, volatility, and Sharpe Ratio were computed and plotted to form the Efficient Frontier — which identifies optimal portfolios offering maximum return for a given level of risk.

### 8. Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
The portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio was identified as the optimal portfolio, providing the best risk-adjusted performance.

### 9. Beta Calculation
Beta was calculated relative to the market index to measure systematic risk and sensitivity to market movements.

### 10. CAPM Analysis
Expected returns were estimated using the CAPM formula:

```
Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × (Market Return − Risk-Free Rate)
```

Actual returns were then compared against CAPM expected returns to determine whether stocks are over- or under-performing relative to market expectations.

## 📂 Python Implementation

Below are the key code snippets used in this project.

### 1️⃣ Import Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

stocks = ['RELIANCE.NS', 'TCS.NS', 'HDFCBANK.NS', 'INFY.NS', 'ICICIBANK.NS']
data = yf.download(stocks, start="2019-01-01", end="2024-01-01")['Adj Close']

daily_returns = data.pct_change().dropna()

annual_returns = daily_returns.mean() * 252
annual_volatility = daily_returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)

risk_free_rate = 0.06
sharpe_ratio = (annual_returns - risk_free_rate) / annual_volatility

num_portfolios = 10000
```

## Key Concepts Applied

- Annual Return
- Volatility
- Sharpe Ratio
- Beta
- CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
- Efficient Frontier
- Portfolio Optimization
- Diversification

---

## Results & Insights

- Higher return stocks generally exhibited higher volatility.
- Diversification reduced overall portfolio risk.
- The Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio provided the best risk-adjusted performance.
- Some stocks outperformed their CAPM-expected return.
- Portfolio optimization significantly improved return per unit of risk.

---

## Conclusion

This project successfully applies Modern Portfolio Theory to analyze and optimize a portfolio of Indian large-cap stocks. The analysis confirms that:

- Risk and return are positively related.
- Diversification reduces unsystematic risk.
- Portfolio optimization improves risk-adjusted performance.
- CAPM provides a useful benchmark for expected returns.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in financial analysis, portfolio optimization, risk management, and data analysis using Python.
